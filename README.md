# COMP 271 SU25 WEEK 10

This assignment has two parts: a reflection part to evaluate work you have already submitted and **a reflection to evaluation your overall work and propose your final grade for the course.**


## Finals week policy

There is no final exam for the course. There will be a final assignemnt that will be published the week before finals and will be due the week of finals. Additionally, 8 students in the course will be invited randomly to a brief meeting with the instructor during the course's final exam slot. 

These meetings will be scheduled on **Wednesday August 6, from 9 to 11 AM** in 15-minute slots. If you are selected, randomly, for an oral followup, you will be notified by email on Monday 8/4/25 at 11 AM.

## Reflect

Compare your code from the previous assignment with [Leo's posted solutions](./SolutionsWeek09.java).

Then write a brief reflection (100-300 words) discussing what you got right, what you got close but not quite, and where you may have missed the mark. Also discuss what you learned by comparing your code to the posted solutions. The reflection must be substantive. For example, you may find that you missed something in the assignment because you did not put enough time in it or because you did not start work early. It's fine to acknowledge these issues. It is also important to propose a plan to avoid them in the future. And, in later reflections, evaluate how that plan worked.

#### How to submit

Your reflection should be submitted together with the current homework assignment due 6/25. Write your reflection as a *markdown* file called `reflection.md` in the current assignment's repository. **MarkDown** is a fairly simple markup (I know!) language that's worth learning. You can use a [simple cheat sheet](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/) for MarkDown (.md) files or you can look at the course code of any `.md` file I share with you such as this one here. You can open any `.md` file on your CodeSpaces editor to see how it's written. 

If MarkDown is not your cup of tea that's ok too. Write your reflection in an email and send it to me with the header "reflection" in the subject line. But if you see yourself as a programmer/computer scientist down the road, it's worth the time to learn to write in MarkDown.



# Reflect (on the course)

*Write the reflection for the course in a file named `final_reflection`. This can be a txt file or a markdown file. The last paragraph of your reflection should be a sentence in the form: "Based on the above, I propose X as my final grade.* Replace X with A, B, C, or D.

As part of this courseâ€™s approach to **ungrading**, your final reflection is an opportunity to evaluate your own learning, growth, and contributions. You will also propose your **final course grade** (**A**, **B**, **C**, or **D**). Please do not use pluses or minuses; I may apply them if I believe itâ€™s appropriate based on your reflection and overall performance.


## ðŸ§  Framing the Reflection

Think of this course as a job you enjoyed â€” one where you were motivated to do well, grow your skills, and support the team. Would you say your performance this term deserves recognition, advancement, or improvement? Use that lens to guide your reflection.

Your self-evaluation should address the following areas as **indicators**, not rigid requirements. Use them to tell a thoughtful, honest story of how you approached the course.

If your proposed grade differs significantly from your assigned grade, I will provide you with a written explanation and an opportunity to discuss the matter with me.


## ðŸ“Œ Key Areas for Reflection

### 1. Attendance & Punctuality
- Were you consistently present in class?
- Did you miss fewer than five class meetings?
- Did you arrive (or log in) on time â€” ideally before or by 11:30 AM?

### 2. Participation & Engagement
- Did you actively contribute to class discussions â€” either by answering questions, asking your own, or helping peers?
- Did you take initiative in your learning, e.g., exploring beyond the homework or trying optional problems?

### 3. Presence & Focus
- Were you fully mentally present during class sessions?
- Were you free from distractions like driving, traveling, or multitasking during Zoom classes?
- Did you seek help when needed â€” e.g., attending office hours, emailing questions, or discussing challenges?

### 4. Assignment Timeliness
- Did you submit your work on time and keep up with due dates?

### 5. Reflection & Growth
- Did you review the posted solutions thoughtfully?
- Did you compare them to your own work and reflect on improvements?
- Did you follow through on those reflections in future assignments?

### 6. Code Quality
- Did your code meet the assignment requirements?
- Did it reflect clear logic, correct functionality, and effort to improve based on feedback?
- Did your code comply with the [Programmer's Pact](./ProgrammerPact.pdf)? The Pact was included with nearly every assignment and was mentioned explicitly in them as a requirement.


## ðŸ“£ Final Thoughts

In your reflection, you're encouraged to highlight specific moments where you:
- Overcame a challenge,
- Helped a classmate,
- Took initiative to go deeper,
- Or simply made progress youâ€™re proud of.

This isnâ€™t just about assigning yourself a grade â€” itâ€™s about owning your learning journey.
